## [Unreleased v0.0.10] - TBD

Under development using Godot 3.4.2.stable.

Requires non-Git-tracked [development assets from 2021-12-28](https://github.com/ivoyager/non_release_assets/releases/tag/2021-12-28).

The main goal for v0.0.10 is to deploy the Planetarium as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-web-progress-report-8). 

### Added
* A project level CHANGELOG.md!
* Top level 'planetarium_assets' directory with PWA icon assets (and moved PBD image here). Because there aren't many non-core assets here, we are allowing these to be Git tracked.

##
*Older project-level changes are documented in* [ivoyager/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

[Unreleased v0.0.10]: https://github.com/ivoyager/planetarium/compare/v0.0.9-alpha...HEAD
