class_name SIBaseUnits

# We keep this static class outside of the 'ivoyager' submodule so projects can
# modify scale, if needed. 

# SI base units - all internal sim values derived from these!
const METER := 1e-13 # engine length units per meter; see Notes below
const SECOND := 1.0
const KG := 1.0
const AMPERE := 1.0
const KELVIN := 1.0
const CANDELA := 1.0

# Notes on base SI units:
#
# See ivoyager/static/units.gd for conversion of base SI units to derived
# units. These affect internal float representation of quantities, but not
# physics or display. Values here don't matter *in theory* because *everything*
# is converted. E.g., if you double METER here, then the gravitational constant
# will be appropriately increased by eight-fold. 
#
# However, in practice, proper visual display is sensitive to METER. This works
# in conjunction with dynamic changes in Camera.near and .far (see
# ivoyager/tree_nodes/vygr_camera.gd) to show extreems of close (asteroid-sized
# objects) to extreems of far (200 AU solar system view).
# For Godot 3.2.2 and before, 1e-9 or smaller worked well. With Godot 3.2.3, we
# needed to decrease to 1e-13 to eliminate visual glitches. These problems most
# likely arise from inconsistency of double versus single precision floats in
# different parts of the Godot Engine. (Rendering of course, but also things
# like AABB and other built-ins, I believe.)
